1.
There are no negative coordinates and the origin is not in the center but in the upper left corner.

2. 
```python
import pygame
pygame.init()
```

3.
In digital devices, colors are represented using a combination of red, green, and blue (RGB) values. Each color channel can have a value between 0 and 255, where 0 represents the absence of that color and 255 represents the maximum intensity of that color. 

Therefore, the RGB value (255, 255, 255) represents the maximum intensity of all three colors - red, green, and blue. This combination of maximum intensity of all three colors results in the color white. 

Hence, WHITE = (255, 255, 255) represents the color white in digital devices.

4.
All uppercase variables are constants and should not change once defined.

5.
The pygame.display.set_mode() takes as input a tuple representing the size of the window or surface in pixels, and an optional argument specifying additional display options such as whether to enable full-screen mode or hardware acceleration. Once the window or surface is created, it can be used to display graphics using other Pygame functions and modules.

6.
The "for event in pygame.event.get()" loop is used to continuously check for events (such as mouse clicks, keyboard presses, etc.) that occur within the Pygame window. Each event is stored in the "event" variable, and the loop iterates through all the events that have occurred since the last time it was called. This allows the program to respond to user input in real-time and update the display accordingly.

7.
pygame.time.Clock is used to control the frame rate of a Pygame program. It is used to ensure that the program runs at a consistent speed, regardless of the speed of the computer it is running on. By setting the desired frame rate using the clock.tick() method, the program can limit the number of times it updates the display per second, preventing it from running too fast and using up unnecessary resources.

8.
- "screen" is the parameter for the screen. When drawing, one has to define where to draw on.
- [0, 0] are the parameters where the line should start. 0|0 is the upper left corner.
- [100, 100] is the parameter where the line should end. 100|100 means, the line ends 100 pixels right and 100 pixels under the upper left corner.
- 5 is the parameter for the thickness of the line. Default is 0.

9.
Use a while or for loop whith an offset.

10.
When the widh of the border is set to zero, the whole surface is filled with the defined color.

11.
Origin of the rectangle surrounding the ellipse is (20|20) with a widh of 250 and hight of 100. The ellipse and and rectangle have the same height and widh.

12.
Because an arc is just a piece of an ellipse, two additional parameters to define the start and end angles are needed. 

13.
First, initiate the pygame.font module and set the parameters for the font type (like calibri or arial).
Second, render the desired text on a new image with pygame.font.Font.render().
Third, merge the new rendered image with the screen with blit().

14.
This is because creating a font object and rendering text is a relatively expensive operation in terms of processing power. By creating the font object and rendering the text only once at the start of the program, it saves resources and improves the overall performance of the program. If the font object and text rendering were done inside the main program loop, it would unnecessarily use up resources and slow down the program.

15.
The coordinates of the corners of the rectangle are the same as the parameters: [50,100],[0,200],[200,200],[100,50].

16.
pygame.display.flip() displays the canvas on the screen after everything is finished drawing. This way, there is no weird delay when drawing complex objects on the screen because everything is first drawn and displayed at the same time.

17.
pygame.quit() uninitializes all pygame modules that have been previously initialized. It is typically called at the end of a pygame program to free up any resources used by the pygame modules.

18.
```python
pygame.draw.circle(screen, BLACK, [100,100],20) #black circle at 100|100 with a radius of 20
```
