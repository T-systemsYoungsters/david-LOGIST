# Worksheet
1.
guess:
```shell
> 0
> 2
> 4
> 6
> 8
```
actual output:
```shell
0
2
4
6
8
```

2.
guess:
```shell
1
2
4
8
16
32
```
actual output:
```shell
1
2
4
8
16
32
```
3.
Because x is increasing and starting at 0, x will always be >=0. Therefore it is not needed.

4.
The program prints out
```shell
5
4
3
2
1
```
and not "Blast off!", because x is defined as an integer, not as a string.

5.
```python
x=0
while x <= 0:
    x = float(input("Enter a number greater than zero: "))
    print("Too small. Enter a number greater than zero: ")
```

6.
```python
x = 10
while x > 0:
    print(x)
    x -= 1
print("Blast-off")
```

7.
```python
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```
the function range() automatically starts at i=0 and combined with the for-loop increments

8.
Because the for loop in the second sample was put into another loop, x gets incrementet i*j times. If they are not put into each other, x is only incrementet i+j times.
