8. Create a class called Star that will print out “A star is born!” every time it is created.

# Chapter 12 Worksheet

### Section 1

1.
An object is an instance of a class. An object is a class but not the other way around.

2.
A method is a function of a class and can not exist without it.

3.
```python
dog = Dog()
dog.age= 40
dog.name= "Dexter"
dog.weight= 40
```

4.
```python
person1= Person()
person1.name= "Dieter"
person1.cell_phone= "0900666666"
person1.email= "ab@c.de"

person2= Person()
person2.name= "Herbert"
person2.cell_phone= "030110"
person2.email= "herbert@groenemeier.de"
```

5.
```python
class Bird():
    def __init__(self):
        self.color=""
        self.name=""
        self.breed=""
```

6.
```python
class Character():
    def __init__(self):
        self.xpos=0
        self.ypos=0
        self.name=""
        self.strengh=0
```

7.
She has to use the dot operator with the object. e.g.: nancy.name= "Nancy".

8.
Same as before. "bob.money" instead of just "money".

9.
The variable self.name got constructed with an empty string and was not altered. Therefore there is nothing to print but an empty string for bob.name.

10.
Person has a Checking account.
A Mortgage account is a checking account.
A Customer is a Person.
A Withdraw is a Transaction.
A Bank Account is a Deposit.
A SSN is an Adress.

11.
When a Class is inherited. The inheritet class _is a_ main Class (with the same attributes and methods). Example:
```python
class Mainclass(): #This is the Main class
    pass
class Subclass(Mainclass): # Now Subclass is a Mainclass
    pass
```

12.
Each class _has_ its own attributes and methods. Example:
```python
class Foo():
    def __init__(self):
        self.name=""
```
An instance of Foo _will have a_ name. This is the same for methods and additional attributes.

13.
by using a list

### Section 2

```python
class Animal():
    def __init__(self):
        self.name=""
        print("An animal has been born.")
    def eat(self):
        print("Munch munch.")
    def make_noise(self):
        print("Grrr, says", self.name)

class Cat(Animal):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        print("A cat has been born.")
    def make_noise(self):
        print("Meow says", self.name)

class Dog(Animal):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        print("A dog has been born.")
    def make_noise(self):
        print("Bark says", self.name)

def main():
    cat= Cat()
    dog1 = Dog()
    dog2 = Dog()
    animal = Animal()
    cat.name="Kater-Pillar"
    dog1.name = "Shredder"
    dog2.name = "Boxer"
    animal.name = "Tier"
    animal.make_noise()
    animal.eat()
    dog1.eat()
    dog2.eat()
    cat.make_noise()
    dog1.make_noise()
    cat.eat()
    dog2.make_noise()

if __name__=="__main__":
    main()
```
