# Worksheet 8
1.
rect_x gets reset to 50 each frame

2.
rect_x is the position of the square on the x-axis
rect_y is the position of the square on the y-axis
rect_change_x is the speed / amount of pixels the square moves in x direction each frame
rect_change_y is the speed / amount of pixels the square moves in y direction each frame

3.
The code should check if y>380.

4.
The variable rect_y is ist inverted, when the rectangle touches the border, not rect_change_y as it should be.

5.
He can implement one additional variable that is added to the ones for head, torso, etc. When changing the whole figure, one only needs to change the new implemented variable.

6.
Because each frame the stars will be at a different position.

7.
Make a list including every item and animate (draw again in a different position) one after another.

8.
```python
print(stars[1][0])
```

9.
The x and y coordinates are stored as a list in a list, so snow_list[i] stands for [x,y].

10.
The program prints a line of points with an offset using the math.sin() and math.cos() functions, while the angle is increased by a fixed amount. The sin and cos functions are like a linear function, where every x has its own value f(x) with the only difference that the line is curved.
