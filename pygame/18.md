# Worksheet 18

1.
An __exception__ is the handling of an unintendet error in the program flow.
**exception handling** means catching the error so that the program can continue without breaking.
A **try block** runs a code that could result in an error. This error is then processed by a **catch block**, wich is the **except** block in python.
An **unhandled exception** results in a program stop because there is no catch block (exception handling).
To **throw** means to trigger an exception without actually producing it. In python this is achieved with the **raise** command.

```python
try:
    user_input=int(input("Enter a number :"))
except:
    print("Error: Number conversion unsuccessful.")
```
