# Worksheet 20

1.
```python
score = 41237
highscore = 1023407
 
print("Score: {:15,}".format(score) )
print("High score: {:10,}".format(highscore))
```

2.
```python
for i in range(1,21):
    print("1/{:<2} = {:0.3}".format(i, 1/i))
```

3.
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n==1:
        return 1
    else:
        n=fibonacci(n-1)+fibonacci(n-2)
        return n
    
for i in range(1,36):
    print("{:>2} - {:11,}".format(i, fibonacci(i)))
```

Because the code is recursive, it needs exponentially longer to finish, because for every step, the code is run till it returns a 1. It would be a lot faster if it would memorize the two last results and sum them up instead.
