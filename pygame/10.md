# Chapter 10 Worksheet

1.
One y argument is missing. Also the body should be drawn before the head that they don't overlap.

2.
One can get the mouse coordinates with pygame.mouse.get_pos() or specifically the x coordinate with pygame.mouse.get_pos()[0]

3.
If the event processing is not implemented in an if-elif chain, events could be processed multiple times, while others will not be recognized at all.

4.
We want the object to move all the time while the button is pressed. If we just changed the direction of movement with -1, an object would move left after it bumped into the right wall while the right button is pressed and not the left.

5.
Because pygame.mouse.get_pos() returns both x and y coordinates while buttons and joysticks boolean values (or between -1 and 1 for the joysticks), the former have to be implemented with a starting value of x and y and an additional speed.

6.
A joystick pushed all the way to the right and down will return the value (1,1).
