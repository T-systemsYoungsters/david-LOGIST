# Worksheet 19

1.
The joke is a bit of a tongue-in-cheek statement because it implies that in order to understand recursion, you need to already understand it, creating a circular dependency. It's a humorous way to point out that recursion can be challenging to grasp when you're first introduced to it, as it often requires you to think in a more abstract and self-referential manner. Once you grasp the concept and the underlying logic, though, it becomes much more manageable and can be a valuable tool in problem-solving.

2. 
If we think of a mirror as an IO-Device, two of them facing each other would recursively input light and give the output back to the other mirror, wich gives back another image and so on and so on...

3.
MLM can only generate "profit without work" because the people pay a "fee" wehen joining and they need to incorporate other people below them. This way, someone is aquired to get people, these people are aquired to get more people and so on...

4.
The function that clears all the empty fields could also call itself on the neighbouring fields until all empty neighboring fields are cleared. 

5.
Have a "try a way function" and at every corner, try all possible directions until you find the exit/goal.

```python
def f(n):
    if n==1:
        return 6
    elif n>1:
        n=0.5*(f(n-1))+4
        return n

for i in range(1,11):
    print("n=", i, "a=", f(i))
```

```python
def f(n):
    if n==1:
        return 1
    elif n==2:
        return 1
    elif n>2:
        n=f(n-1)+f(n-2)
        return n

for i in range(1,11):
    print("n=", i, "a=", f(i))
